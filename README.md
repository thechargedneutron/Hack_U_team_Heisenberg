# Hack_U_team_Heisenberg

This repository contains my project for Hack U competition conducted by Yahoo! Japan at IIT Bombay. 
The hacks that we made are:

1. Auto-brightness

This uses webcam to detect the brightness level and adjusts the screen brightness according to it.

2. Anti-sleep Alarm
This uses webcam to detect your body movement. If the body is still for more than a particular time period, an alarm starts ringing, which goes off when we move.

3. Intruder-alert
This program minimises all the active window when someone comes into the frame of the webcam, thus enabling privacy.

4. Auto-shutdown
It power offs the laptop if the user moves out of the frame and do not return after a fixed time
